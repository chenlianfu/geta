[hisat2-build]
-p 1
# note: the multi threads parameter -p was set to 1 by default, which was not passed by --CPU as usual.

# During the step of sam2transfrag: --no_strand_specific was passed reversely by --strand_specific; 
# If RNA-Seq reads containig single-end data, the --no_PE_sequencing should be added. Otherwise, the alignment of single-end will be ignored.
# The defalut value means: the dynamic coverage threshold of mapping regions (come frome SAM file) was determinated by the maximum base depth of each region * 0.05, as well as this threshold should between 2 and 50.

[TransDecoder.LongOrfs]
-m 100 -G universal
# note: the strand specific parameter -S will be set automatically if transcripts had introns which could determinated the direction.

[TransDecoder.Predict]
--retain_long_orfs_mode dynamic
# note: when predicting the ORF of transfrag with single exon, the parameter --train will be set automatically to the result of transfrag with multi exons.

[homolog_genewise]

[remove_genes_in_repeats]
--ratio 0.2
# The gene models overlapping with repeats was removed if the overlap ratio of CDS region >= 0.8 . If this value was set > 1.0, the gene models overlapping with repeats would not be removed.
